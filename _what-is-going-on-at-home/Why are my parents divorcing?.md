<p>There are different reasons why some parents separate or divorce. Usually,
it’s because one or both are unhappy in the relationship and/or their feelings
towards each other have changed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sometimes, even after they try their best to make things work, they are
still unable to sort out their problems or differences together and think
they need to be apart to make things better.</p>
