<p>When parents separate or divorce, there might be several changes in your
daily routine:</p>
<div class="isomer-card-grid">
<div class="isomer-card">
<div class="isomer-card-body">
<div class="isomer-card-title">Spending time with each parent separately</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="isomer-card">
<div class="isomer-card-body">
<div class="isomer-card-title">New living and school arrangements</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="isomer-card">
<div class="isomer-card-body">
<div class="isomer-card-title">Spending more or less time with friends, siblings or relatives</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p></p>
<p>You might also notice that you and your parents and siblings seem different
during this time period. For example, you or they might seem more distracted
or sad, begin to do things differently or develop new habits and interests.</p>
<p>These could be part of your or their own responses to the changes.</p>
