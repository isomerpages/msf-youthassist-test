<p>"I started volunteering more in my CCA and usually stayed back after classes
to help the team out in whatever they needed to do, slowly I started realising
that thoughts about CCAs and activities replaced the stress I had about
what was going on at home."</p>

<div class="isomer-card-description">"When everything felt chaotic, routines helped. Setting specific times
for studying, meals and relaxation provided a sense of control and stability
amidst the changes. If home feels stressful, try finding a spot in school
or the library (or a nice caf√©; food for the stomach, homework for the
mind)."</div>
