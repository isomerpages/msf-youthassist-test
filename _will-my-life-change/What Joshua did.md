<p><strong>Take your time to open up with people you trust</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eventually being open/upfront about your parentâ€™s being divorced to your
friends or classmates! you donâ€™t have to go into any pressing details,
and your friends may not know how to react at first, but if you normalise
it among your circle, I found it really comforting to have friends who
understand what youâ€™re going/went through, even superficially. and it can
help that they are slightly more sensitive about bringing things up around
you!&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;Itâ€™s entirely okay to stay back in school more (played a lot of
after-school â€˜catchingâ€™ in primary school) and it helped me relieve and
avoid the stress of my household matters. I made a lot of friends and found

<p><strong>Learn to take charge of your routines and relationships</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;If youâ€™re able to transport independently (e.g. in secondary school) <em>take more initiative/control in managing your relationships</em> with
the family you no longer stay with or see as often (parent that left, grandparents
on that side, etc.) it can be exhausting to be regularly fetched around
every time to see someone, and especially frustrating when someone who
used to live with you becomes a whole â€˜weekend activityâ€™. however, I found
that if you took charge of managing that relationship on your own terms
(e.g. choosing to go after school by yourself), it can be more convenient
for you logistically, and that gives you motivation to build a more secure
and comfortable post-divorce relationship with your parents&nbsp;</p>
