<p><strong>Create a Stable Routine</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When everything around me felt chaotic, having a routine really would
help. Setting specific times for studying, meals, and even relaxation provided
a sense of control and more importantly stability amidst all these changes
related to the divorce/separation. Don’t feel the need to study at home,
if you feel home feels too stressful, consider finding a spot in the library
or your school (or a café with a good menu, that’s what I did; food for
the stomach and homework for the mind). It might help to use time management
techniques like the Pomodoro Technique, time blocking, or the ABCDE Method
to stay on top of tasks without feeling overwhelmed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pomodoro Technique: Working in focused bursts (e.g. 30-45mins) with short
breaks.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Time Blocking: Allocate specific time blocks for different tasks or subjects.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ABCDE Method: Assign letters to tasks based on their importance (A being
the most important). Tackle tasks in alphabetical order.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Set Small, Achievable Goals</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Breaking down large tasks into smaller, manageable steps can make schoolwork
feel less daunting. I found that setting daily or weekly goals and celebrating
the small wins kept me motivated (e.g. I was always very excited to strike
a task from my long to-do list). The sense of accomplished drove me to
stay positive and focused on making steady progress.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Use School as a Positive Distraction</strong>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>School can be a great way to take your mind off things. Finding subjects
or activities you enjoy, like CCAs or other school programs, can keep you
engaged and focused on something constructive. I started volunteering more
in my CCA and usually stayed back after classes to help the team out in
whatever they needed to do, slowly I started realising that thoughts about
CCAs and activities replaced the stress I had about what was going on at
home.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Emotional Check-ins Before Studying</strong>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When parents are going through divorce/separation, it is entirely okay
and perfectly normal to feel anxious and stressed, even for the entire
day. As such, before diving into schoolwork, it would be a good practice
to take a moment and check in with yourself because after all, we know
ourselves the best! Identifying how you’re feeling—whether it’s stress,
anxiety, or something else—can help you address those emotions before focusing
on your studies. In the event that you feel that you are not in the state
to do work, it is alright to spend some time engaging in tasks to better
concentrate, going for short walks or watching short videos really works
for me.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Prioritize Self-Care</strong>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Balancing school and stress is important. I made it a point to prioritise
sleep, healthy eating, and physical activity, which all helped improve
my focus and well-being. You do not have to follow a structured set of
rules or follow others when it comes to self-care, feel free to create
your own creative outlets like art, writing, or music to help you process
emotions. Remember, taking care of yourself is key to maintaining both
mental and physical health.&nbsp;</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Stay Connected with Peers</strong>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>While you might feel you don’t have anyone to rely on especially not your
parents, it does not mean that you are indeed alone. It is fine to feel
like you need more support to handle the wide range of emotions that you
are feeling. Maintaining friendships can provide this much-needed support
and a sense of normalcy. I leaned on my friends, and it made a huge difference
in keeping me grounded and motivated. Having a strong support system can
help you feel less isolated and remember you don’t have to go through it
alone!&nbsp;</p>
