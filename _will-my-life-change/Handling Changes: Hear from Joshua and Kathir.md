try being open or upfront about your parent’s being divorced to your friends
or classmates."</p>

<div class="isomer-card-description">"You don’t have to go into pressing details, and your friends may not
know how to react at first, but if you normalise it among your circle,
I found it really comforting to have friends who understand, even superficially.
It can help that they are more sensitive when bringing things up around
you!"</div>

<blockquote>
<p>"I started volunteering more in my CCA and usually stayed back after classes
to help the team out in whatever they needed to do, slowly I started realising
that thoughts about CCAs and activities replaced the stress I had about
what was going on at home."</p>
