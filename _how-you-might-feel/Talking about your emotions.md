<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consider approaching
the person you trust and saying, “Can we talk for a minute? I have something
to share.” You can then share how you feel and think, including what bothers
you and what you want. You may be surprised that someone can help you feel
better and assure you that you are not alone.</p>
<p></p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If talking to someone
is too hard, try writing down or recording what you want to say. You may
sit with them while they read or listen to it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Keep in mind that you
don’t have to wait for your feelings and problems to be big or have a special
time to talk about them. It’s good to talk about them earlier as it allows
you to understand and deal with them. The more you talk about it, the easier
it may get.&nbsp;</p>
