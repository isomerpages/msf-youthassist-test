<h3>You don’t have to wait for your feelings and problems to be big or have a special time to talk about them. </h3>
<p>It’s good to talk about them earlier as it allows you to understand and
deal with them. The more you talk about it, the easier it may get.&nbsp;Consider
approaching the person you trust and saying,</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<h4>“Can we talk for a minute? I have something to share.” </h4>
</blockquote>
<p>You can then share how you feel and think, including what bothers you
and what you want. You may be surprised that someone can help you feel
better and assure you that you are not alone.</p>
<p>If talking to someone is too hard, try writing down or recording what
you want to say. You may sit with them while they read or listen to it.</p>
