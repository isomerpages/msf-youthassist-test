<p>When experiencing strong or uncomfortable emotions, remind yourself that
they are not permanent, just like waves in the ocean.</p>
<p>It is helpful to be gentle and patient with yourself while allowing these
emotions to come and go with time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;To cope with and manage your strong emotions, consider these strategies:</p>

<h5>&nbsp; Recognise, acknowledge, and validate your feelings (e.g., “I am feeling … because/when … ” and “It is OK to feel sad”).</h5>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Find healthy ways to express your feelings.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Talk to an adult that you trust (e.g., one or both of your
parents, a relative, or a teacher)</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Writing/Journaling</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Art</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Music</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Crying is a natural and healthy emotional response, not
a sign of weakness, serving to release emotions.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Exercise, such as walking, running and playing sports</p>
