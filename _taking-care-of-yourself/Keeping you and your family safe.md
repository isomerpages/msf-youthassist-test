<p>Everyone deserves to feel safe, both physically and emotionally. If there's
violence in your family, or if you or someone in your family is being hurt
and you feel unsafe, tell an adult so the harm can stop. If you donâ€™t feel
comfortable talking to someone at home or school, consider contacting the
National Anti-Violence &amp; Sexual Harassment (NAVH) Helpline at 1800-777-0000
or make an <a href="https://form.gov.sg/6376fbdc8d8be90012d8e56b" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">online report</a>.
If there is immediate danger to life and safety, please call the Police
at 999 or SMS 71999.</p>
