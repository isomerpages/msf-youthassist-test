<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Change is not always easy. Some
changes may be challenging and take some time for you and your family to
accept, adjust and adapt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here are some tips that may help
you handle some of the changes/challenges:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Give yourself the time and space for adjustment.</em> As
you may be going back and forth between two homes or meeting new people
in your new school or neighbourhood, give yourself time to learn and get
used to the new surroundings and routines without rushing the process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also want to discuss the changes to expect with your parent(s).
Further, you may want to keep track of your new routines using a calendar
and keep comforting and favourite items in your designated private space
in each home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Speak up:</em> It
can be confusing or upsetting when you hear about your parents’ divorce.
If you feel safe, pick a time to ask your parent(s) your questions. You
may want to remind yourself, “Even though my parents argue, they still
love me very much.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your parents argue or are unkind to each other, you may want to find
an opportunity to let them know it bothers you so that they can try to
relate to each other better around you. Alternatively, you can try to stay
out of their argument (e.g. leave the room) as your feelings and well-being
are important too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><em>Remember, you don’t have to “take sides” or decide “who is right or wrong”. </em></strong>Sometimes,
you may feel caught in between your parents’ arguments or that you have
to pick one over the other. Do remind yourself that your parents may argue
because they disagree, but they are adults, and they can handle their disagreements
by themselves. Further, your parents can reach out to the professionals
to receive the support they need and to help them sort out their differences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may feel like you need to step in to intervene, but you do not need
to be involved in their arguments or help them fix their problems in their
marriage. Remember, you don’t have to pick sides, and you can love both
parents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iv.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><em>Talk with other people you trust</em></strong>.
This can be a relative, teacher, counsellor or friend. Sometimes, talking
to someone you trust can help sort your feelings and thoughts out and make
you feel better. It may also help you see things differently and understand
your situation and yourself better.&nbsp;Click <a href="#_3c)_Talking_about" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a> to read how you may talk about your

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; v.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Focus on what you can control</em>,
such as your personal and academic goals. This can give you a sense of
purpose and direction. It is also helpful to keep up with your daily activities,
including school, hobbies, and socialising, as routine can provide stability.
