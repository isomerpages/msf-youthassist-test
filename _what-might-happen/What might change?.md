<p>Â·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When parents separate or divorce,
there might be several changes in your daily routine. For example, you
might spend time with each parent separately, have new living and school
arrangements, or spend more/less time with your friends, siblings and extended
family. You might also notice that you and your parents and siblings seem
different during this time period. For example, you or they might seem
more distracted or sad, begin to do things differently or develop new habits
and interests. These could be part of your/their own responses to the changes.</p>
