<p>While things in the family can change, some things will stay the same:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Your parents still love you:</strong> Even
though they're no longer together, your parents are still your parents.
Their love for you doesn’t change.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Your bond with your parents and siblings is still yours:</strong> Family
is more than just living under the same roof—it's the bond you share with
your family members. Even if your family looks different now, it does not
mean your bond with them will end. It is okay to express your love and
care for them if you wish. You can still create special moments and memories
with them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>You are still the special and unique person you always were.</strong> You
still go to school and have your friends, talents, interests and hobbies.
You can keep doing the things that make you happy and stay connected with
the people who matter to you. Try thinking of all the things you love to
do and are good at and about the things or people you are grateful for
in your life.</p>
