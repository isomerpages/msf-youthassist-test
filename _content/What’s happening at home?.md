<h2>Why are my parents divorced/divorcing? Why can't they stay together?</h2>
<p></p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are different reasons why some parents
separate or divorce. Usually, it’s because one or both are unhappy in the
relationship and/or their feelings towards each other have changed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes, even after they try their best to
make things work, they are still unable to sort out their problems or differences
together and think they need to be apart to make things better.</p>
<p></p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This doesn’t mean they don’t care or love you
anymore. It’s just that they have differences or issues that make it hard
for them to live together anymore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Divorce is never an easy decision for anyone,
and it is usually the last resort when all things don’t work.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Is it my fault?</h2>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is important to remember that your parent’s
divorce is not your fault.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes, it’s easy to feel like you did something
wrong, especially when their disagreement is in some way related to you,
or you feel that you could have prevented it. However, this is not true.
Your parents separated because it is too hard for them to negotiate their
difficulties and differences anymore, not because of you. It is understandable
to feel upset or confused when a situation like this occurs, but remember
that you are not responsible for their decisions.&nbsp;</p>
