<h2>Why are my parents divorced/divorcing? Why can't they stay together?</h2>
<p></p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are different reasons why some parents
separate or divorce. Usually, it’s because one or both are unhappy in the
relationship and/or their feelings towards each other have changed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes, even after they try their best to
make things work, they are still unable to sort out their problems or differences
together and think they need to be apart to make things better.</p>
<p></p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This doesn’t mean they don’t care or love you
anymore. It’s just that they have differences or issues that make it hard
for them to live together anymore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Divorce is never an easy decision for anyone,
and it is usually the last resort when all things don’t work.&nbsp;</p>
