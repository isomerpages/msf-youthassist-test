<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is perfectly fine and crucial to seek out
support from people you trust at any stage of your parent’s divorce or
separation —before, during, or after the process. You are not alone; there
is available support.</p>
<p>&nbsp;·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Remember, seeking support does not mean
you’re weak. Rather, it is a sign of strength and a way to stay strong.
Further, staying connected with the people who care about you often offers
comfort, strength, and practical and emotional support.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Consider this list of people to reach out for support:</p>
