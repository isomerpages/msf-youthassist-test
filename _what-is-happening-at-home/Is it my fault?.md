<h2>Your parents' divorce is not your fault.</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Sometimes, itâ€™s easy to feel like you did something wrong, especially
when their disagreement is in some way related to you, or you feel that
you could have prevented it.</p>

<h4>This is not true.</h4>
<p>Your parents separated because it is too hard for them to negotiate their
difficulties and differences anymore, not because of you.</p>
<p>It is understandable to feel upset or confused when a situation like this
occurs, but remember: that you are not responsible for their decisions.&nbsp;</p>
