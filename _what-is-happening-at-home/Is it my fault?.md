<p>It is important to remember that your parent’s divorce is not your fault.</p>
<p>&nbsp;·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes, it’s easy to feel like you
did something wrong, especially when their disagreement is in some way
related to you, or you feel that you could have prevented it. However,
this is not true. Your parents separated because it is too hard for them
to negotiate their difficulties and differences anymore, not because of
you. It is understandable to feel upset or confused when a situation like
this occurs, but remember that you are not responsible for their decisions.&nbsp;</p>
